# Model Comparison (Compact)

Summary note for commit/history summarization model choices.

## Current default

- `google/flan-t5-base` in current config references

## Selection criteria

- output quality for short technical summaries
- latency and runtime footprint
- operational simplicity for local workflows

## Guidance

- keep this comparison lightweight
- store full experiment logs externally
- revisit only when model choices or constraints change
