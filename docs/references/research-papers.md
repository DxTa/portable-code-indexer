# Research Papers (Compact)

Small reference list used during design discussions.

## Core Topics

- HNSW for approximate nearest-neighbor retrieval
- BM25/lexical ranking for exact token matching
- Hybrid rank fusion strategies (for mixed retrieval pipelines)
- Code retrieval benchmarks and dependency understanding evaluations

## Why these matter here

- Sia Code combines lexical and semantic retrieval.
- Code queries often benefit from exact identifier matching.
- Multi-hop exploration and memory features build on retrieval quality.
